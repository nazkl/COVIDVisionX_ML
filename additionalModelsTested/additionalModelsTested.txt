Additional models tested, was not able to deploy. Ran on Google Colab due to GPU limitations on Jupyter Notebook. 

Methods used to expand dataset:
The additional models tested made use of transfer learning from the Imagenet dataset. Imagenet is a widely used dataset that provides labeled images for training deep learning models like ResNet50 and VGG19, which was tested in our project. These models are then fine-tuned or used as a starting point for various image-related tasks, benefiting from the pre-learned features from Imagenet. Using transfer learning reduces training time and data amount requirements, and lowers the generalisation error rate. After the model has been trained, we can then fine-tune them to meet our requirements.

To run: 
1. Download .ipynb notebook file and upload into Google Colab. 
2. Download datasets and upload into a folder in Google Colab
3. Change required filepaths accordingly in the notebook file
4. Change runtime type to "GPU" before execution
5. Run all cells
